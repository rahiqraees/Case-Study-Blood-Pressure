# Multivariable Regression Project â€” Blood Pressure Case Study

This project presents a **multivariable regression analysis** on a blood pressure case study. The dataset included **500 predictors** (483 genetic markers and 17 clinical covariates). The analysis applied advanced regression and statistical techniques to identify significant predictors and evaluate model performance.

## ðŸ”¹ Project Overview
- Conducted regression analysis on a dataset with **high-dimensional predictors**  
- Applied **feature selection methods** such as forward selection and backward elimination  
- Used **5-fold cross-validation** to validate model robustness and avoid overfitting  
- Performed statistical testing (ANOVA) to identify significant predictors  
- Documented methodology and findings in an **R Markdown report (PDF)**  

## ðŸ”¹ Key Features
- **Dimensionality Challenge**: Analysis with 500 predictors  
- **Model Selection**: Forward selection & backward elimination for feature subset selection  
- **Validation**: 5-fold cross-validation for model reliability  
- **Statistical Insights**: Identified genetic and clinical factors impacting blood pressure  

## ðŸ”¹ Technologies Used
- R  
- RMarkdown
